/**
 * A better BlockPos that has fewer hash collisions (and slightly more performant offsets)
 * <p>
 * Is it really faster to subclass BlockPos and calculate a hash in the constructor like this, taking everything into account?
 * Yes. 20% faster actually. It's called BETTER BlockPos for a reason. Source:
